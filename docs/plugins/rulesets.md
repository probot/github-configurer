# Repository Rulesets

> [!WARNING]
> Support for Repository Rulesets is still under development.
> Details may still change, like how the configuration is defined in the `settings.yml`.
> Please follow [#732](https://github.com/repository-settings/app/issues/732) for progress updates.
> Feedback is appreciated, but adopt cautiously, with the expectation of breaking changes until support is fully released.

See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules#update-a-repository-ruleset for
